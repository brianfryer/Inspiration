I'm watching a YouTube video and am looking at a slide showing a screenshot of an older version of GitHub. In the top-left corner is the "github" word-mark -- and it looks totally out of place!

This is out github looks today:

Stark, right?

I started thinking about other large websites/apps and really took notice of this header-design trend. They all used to have their logo in the top left, but now it's been replaced with a symbol or functionality. All the focus is driven to the content in the body with the header being a great place to start if you already have an idea of what you're looking for.

Have a look:

Pinterest is the exception here, in that they've kept their logo intact. This is smart, imo, since the site is similar to a magazine.

Hopefully this will be of some assistance for when you begin considering UX improvements for the MarketVibe app. It seems like there's more to having a logo-mark / symbol than meets the eye :-)
